Functional Lens (on Mathematics and Computation)
================================================

These are articles from the blog at http://kennknowles.com/blog which
demonstrate functional programming ideas, libraries, or both.

The articles are mostly literate Haskell + markdown. The code is licensed under
the Apache 2.0 License so you should be able to use it in whatever way you
like. I ask that the actual text of the article not be reproduced in an
expository context except to quote it or cite it. I'm sure it isn't
particularly valuable to anyone except for entertainment anyhow. Be nice :-)
